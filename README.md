# Readability to Instapaper importer

This is a simple script importing all your bookmarked articles from **readability.com** to **instapaper.com**.

## Usage

Clone the repo, install gems, put your data in the config file and run the script:

    bundle install
    vim config.yml
    ruby import.rb

## Development state

The script works fine, but is kinda slow.
