# Readability to Instapaper importer

This is a simple script importing all your bookmarked articles from **readability.com** to **instapaper.com**.

## Usage

Clone the repo, install the gems, and run the `import.rb` script.

## Development state

The script works fine, but is kinda slow (2 HTTP requestes for every imported link).
